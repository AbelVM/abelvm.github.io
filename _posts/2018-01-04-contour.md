There's a bunch of different ways to generate contour lines [1] from scatter data, each of them based on different interpolation algorithms. Like KNN [2], IDW [3] or kriging-flavoured methods [4]. (image from Wikipedia)

But, for performance sake, I'm going to use here a method derived from **marching squares** [5] method, that fits irregularly scattered data points: **meandering triangles** [6]. The algorithm is pretty clearly described in the linked reference, so let's go straight to the code.

First of all, our input is a dataset of points with a numeric value assigned to each of them. And, finally, a list of breaks for our data classification. You may want to hardcode the breaks to arbitrary values, or use some good ol' data classification [7], but let's keep it out of this function. So our input will be:
* geomin: geometries array
* colin: numeric values array
* breaks: numeric breaks array

And our output as a table of:
* geom: contour line geometry
* break: the break assigned to each contour line

First step, assign a bucket to each point using the input breaks, and store it in an array with the same sorting:
```sql
WITH
a as(
    SELECT
        width_bucket(t.x, breaks) as bin
    FROM unnest(colin) as t(x)
)
SELECT array_agg(bin) INTO bucketin FROM a;
```

Then, as the method's name states, we need triangles instead of points! So let's generate a TIN [8] from our scattered points using Delaunay Triangles [9], and store it in a geometries array.
```sql
WITH
a as (
    SELECT unnest(geomin) AS e
    ),
b as (
    SELECT ST_DelaunayTriangles(ST_Collect(a.e)) AS t FROM a
    ),
c as (
    SELECT (ST_Dump(t)).geom AS v FROM b
    )
SELECT array_agg(v) INTO gs FROM c;
```
Now, let's loop over the TIN and apply the **meandering triangles** algorithm to each cell. First of all, we need to identify the vertices of each cell, and the associated values from the original input arrays:
```sql
SELECT
    array_agg(a.v),
    array_agg(b.c), 
    array_agg(b.bk)
INTO 
    vertex, -- vertex geometry 
    vv, -- vertex value
    bu -- vertex bucket
FROM
(
    SELECT (ST_DumpPoints(g)).geom AS v 
    LIMIT 3 -- to drop the repeated 1st point
) as a
CROSS JOIN 
LATERAL(
    SELECT
        t.*
    FROM
        unnest(geomin, colin, bucketin) as t(geo, c, bk)
    WHERE ST_Equals(geo, a.v)
    LIMIT 1
) as b;
```
If the three vertices are in the same bucket, there's no contour line crossing the cell:
```sql
CONTINUE WHEN bu[1] = bu[2] and bu[1] = bu[3];
```
If there are any intersection, let's find them with our support function **_get_cell_intersects** (I will explain it later) that gets the intersections between the contour lines and the cell's sides as a geometry array:
```sql
interp12 := _get_cell_intersects(vertex, vv, bu, breaks,1,2);
interp23 := _get_cell_intersects(vertex, vv, bu, breaks,2,3);
interp31 := _get_cell_intersects(vertex, vv, bu, breaks,3,1);
```
Now that we have the points on each cell's side that belongs to a contour line, let's generate the segments that leave a different bucket value at each side of it. Take into account that there are 27 possible results (image from Wikipedia):
![img](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/9b/Mt-isoband.png)

So, taking into account the corner cases, the code to build the segments looks like:
```sql
WITH
a AS(
    SELECT
        t.*
    FROM
        unnest(breaks, interp12, interp23, interp31) 
        AS t(br, p12 , p23, p31)
),
b AS(
    SELECT
    CASE
    WHEN
    (p12 IS NOT NULL AND p23 IS NOT NULL AND ST_equals(p12, p23)=false) OR
    (p23 IS NOT NULL AND p31 IS NOT NULL AND ST_equals(p23, p31)=false) OR
    (p31 IS NOT NULL AND p12 IS NOT NULL AND ST_equals(p31, p12)=false)
    THEN ST_MakeLine(ARRAY[p12, p23, p31]::geometry[])
    ELSE null::geometry END AS  segm,
    br
    FROM a
)
SELECT
    array_agg(b.segm) INTO segment
FROM unnest(breaks) AS c(x) 
LEFT JOIN b ON b.br = c.x;
```

Now that we have the segments, we add these segments to the calculated in previous iterations, collecting them per break value:
```sql
IF i = 0 THEN
    running_merge = segment;
    i := 1;
ELSE
    WITH
    a AS(
        SELECT
            ST_CollectionExtract(x, 2) AS x,
            y
        FROM unnest(running_merge,segment) AS t(x,y)
    ),
    b AS(
        SELECT
        ST_collect(x,y) AS element
        FROM a
    )
    SELECT
        array_agg(element) INTO running_merge
    FROM b;
END IF;
```
Once we cycle through all the cells in our TIN, we need to sew our segments collections into proper lines and return them:
```sql
RETURN QUERY
WITH a AS(
        SELECT
            br,
            ST_CollectionExtract(geo, 2) AS geo
        FROM unnest(running_merge, breaks) AS t(geo, br)
    ),
    b AS(
        SELECT
            ST_LineMerge(geo) AS geo,
            br
        FROM a
    )
SELECT
    geo AS geom,
    br AS break
FROM b;
```
So, the final function should look like:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION contour_lines(
	IN geomin geometry[],
	IN colin numeric[],
	IN breaks numeric[]

        LEFT JOIN b ON b.br = c.x;

		IF i = 0 THEN
            running_merge = segment;
            i := 1;

	END LOOP;

	RETURN QUERY
	WITH a AS(

```
And the support function, that finds the intersections between the contour lines and a side of a cell, based on the cell data and the indexes of the vertices that defines that side:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION _get_cell_intersects(
	IN vertex geometry[], -- vertices geometries
	IN vv numeric[], -- vertices values
	IN bu integer[], -- vertices buckets
	IN breaks numeric[], -- breaks 
	IN i1 integer, -- first vertex index 
	IN i2 integer -- last vertex index
)
RETURNS geometry[]  AS $$
DECLARE
	result geometry[];
BEGIN
	IF bu[i1] <> bu[i2] THEN
		with
		a as(
			SELECT
				(t.x-vv[i1])/(vv[i2]-vv[i1]) AS p
			FROM unnest(breaks) AS t(x)
		),
		b as(
			SELECT
				case when p BETWEEN 0 AND 1 then 
					ST_LineInterpolatePoint(
						ST_MakeLine(vertex[i1], vertex[i2]), 
						a.p
					)
				else null::geometry end as point
			from a
		)
		SELECT
			array_agg(b.point) INTO result
		FROM b;
	END IF;
	RETURN result;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE PLPGSQL IMMUTABLE;
```

**Updated 29-05-2023** To improve performance of support function and remove corner cases that might lead to crash

**Updated 15-08-2019** to fix a typo in the support function, reported by [@jacksonvoelkel](https://github.com/jacksonvoelkel). Once fixed, he sent [a great use case via twitter](https://twitter.com/geocomputate/status/1162086149742948352?s=20). From thise raw data:
