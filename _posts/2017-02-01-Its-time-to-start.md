# Hello World!

That's it. This is the very first post of this brand new whatever canvas for random stuff. Mainly tech stuff, but who knows. This is the kind of place used to compile little bits of knowledge so I can find them later. Like that old cardboard box full of nuts and bolts, just in case.

Anyway, expect [CARTO](http://www.carto.com) dashboards filling the gallery and lots of snippets of code. And random stuff, unexpected stuff, and, eventually, [platypodes](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/platypodes)
