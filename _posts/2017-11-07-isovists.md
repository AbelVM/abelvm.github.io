First of all, what is an `isovist`? It's simply the same as a `viewshed`... and what the heck is a `viewshed`? Let's go to the **Wikipedia**:

````
A single isovist is the volume of space visible from a given point in space,
together with a specification of the location of that point
````

The decision of using the word `isovist` or `viewshed` is only related to the knowledge field you're working on:

* **Isovist**: architecture, space syntax, landscaping, urbanism, geomarketing
* **viewshed**: geography, infrastructure location

In this article, I'm going to talk about the 2D version of the problem, but could be expanded to cover the 3D case.

Let's define a real use case as a base for later explanations. Let's say we're and ad company and want to place billboards in the facades of buildings in the center of Madrid, targeting the people waiting for the bus at the defined stops. Our target would be to find the facades with the highest `eyeballs` audience. The result should be like this

Cool, isn't it? And how is it done? The answer is quite simple

Yes, magic.



And PostGIS.



Ok, follow me in this journey along this ray-tracing-like approach using a somehow tricky PL/pgSQL function

Let's say, that the point I'm going to study (`center`) has a heading of 270º and a fov of 90º, and the horizon is located at 150m. The arbitrary point for the following images is defined as:

```sql
SELECT ST_SetSRID(ST_MakePoint( -3.705856,40.420371),4326) as center;
```

![img](/images/iso1_crop.png)

First of all, let's think on the macro structure of the problem. We will need a point geometry for any input point and a set of `buildings` polygons. But... we will need some extra parameters too, like:

* `radius`: Horizon distance, so we don't overcharge the calculation with useless info
* `rays`: number of angular steps, that will define the resolution
* `heading`: northing in degrees, to set the direction the `eyeballs` are looking at
* `fov`: field of view in degrees, centered in the heading direction

![img](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Angle_of_view.svg/425px-Angle_of_view.svg.png)



So the signature of the function would be like:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ISOVIST(
    IN center geometry,
    IN polygons geometry[],
    IN radius numeric DEFAULT 150, -- horizon distance in meters
    IN rays integer DEFAULT 36, -- number of rays
    IN heading integer DEFAULT -999, -- take heading (degrees, 0-360) into account
    IN fov integer DEFAULT 360 -- field of view (degrees)
    )
```

Having a default value for `fov` of 360º, so the heading is not needed in this very case.

Once there, let's declare some support variables

```sql
    arc numeric; -- angular resolution
    angle_0 numeric; -- starting angle for fov != 360º
```

And the output

```sql
    geomout geometry; -- resulting geometry of the isovist
```

And calc the values for the support variables:

```sql
    -- resolution in degrees
    arc := fov::numeric / rays::numeric;

    -- fov range start value
    IF fov = 360 THEN
        angle_0 := 0;
    ELSE
        -- centered in heading angle
        angle_0 := heading - 0.5 * fov;
    END IF;
```

Now, we're ready to start querying the data. We're building it with incremental subqueries using `WITH` clause, so each block can be easily explained:

1. Unnest the polygons array to have a table object:

   ```sql
        buildings_0 AS(
           SELECT
               t.geom
           FROM unnest(polygons) as t(geom)
       ),
   ```
   ![img](/images/iso2_crop.png)

2. Filter out the polygons further than the horizon, so we limit the next calculi to the polygons of interest only

   ```sql
      buildings_crop AS(
           SELECT
               geom
           FROM buildings_0
           WHERE
             ST_DWithin(
               center::geography,
               geom::geography,
               radius
             )
       ),
   ```
   ![img](/images/iso3_crop.png)

3. Let's add the horizon as `the final polygon` that stops any ray traced from `center`

   ```sql
       buildings AS(
           SELECT geom FROM buildings_crop
           UNION ALL
           SELECT ST_buffer(center::geography, radius)::geometry as geom
       ),
   ```
   ​

4. Now, we need to create #`rays` rays, from `center`,  each `arc` degrees starting at `angle_0` . To do so, we're gonna use the PostGIS function [ST_Project](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Project.html) that generates a 2nd point from a starting one, a direction and a distance. So my n-th ray will look like

   ```sql
   ST_SetSRID(
       ST_MakeLine(
           center,
           ST_Project(
              center::geography,
              radius + 1,
              radians(angle_0 + n::numeric * arc)
           )::geometry
       ),
    4326) AS geom
   ```

   We use `radius+1` as length to be sure that the ray intersects the horizon at least.

   Using [generate_series](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/functions-srf.html) we can create all the rays at once:

   ```sql
       rays AS(
           SELECT
               t.n as id,
               ST_SetSRID(
                   ST_MakeLine(
                       center,
                       ST_Project(
                          center::geography,
                          radius + 1,
                          radians(angle_0 + t.n::numeric * arc)
                       )::geometry
                   ),
                4326) AS geom
           FROM generate_series(0, rays) as t(n)
       ),
   ```

   ![img](/images/iso4_crop.png)

5. Now, getting the intersections between the rays and the polygons:

   ```sql
       intersections AS(
           SELECT
               r.id,
               (ST_Dump(
                 ST_Intersection(
                   -- to avoid intersections with polygon holes
                   ST_Boundary(b.geom),
                   r.geom
                 )
               )).geom AS point
           FROM
               rays r
           LEFT JOIN
               buildings b
           ON
               ST_Intersects(b.geom,r.geom)
       ),
   ```

   So we translated our rays spectrum into a cloud of points of the intersections between all the rays and all the (external boundaries of the) polygons within range

   ![img](/images/iso5_crop.png)

6. Now, we need to rank the intersections in terms of distance to `center`...

   ```sql
       intersections_distances AS(
           SELECT
               id,
               point as geom,
               row_number() over(partition by id order by center <-> point) as ranking
           FROM intersections
       ),
   ```

   ![img](/images/iso6_crop.png)

7. ...in order to keep only the closest intersection per polygon

   ```sql
       intersection_closest AS(
           SELECT
               -1 as id,
               CASE WHEN fov = 360 THEN null::geometry ELSE center END as geom
           UNION ALL
           (SELECT
               id,
               geom
           FROM intersections_distances
           WHERE ranking = 1
           ORDER BY ID)
           UNION ALL
           SELECT
               999999 as id,
               CASE WHEN fov = 360 THEN null::geometry ELSE center END as geom
       ),
   ```
   

   We are adding the center point twice (before and after all the intersections) in case the `fov` is less than 360º...

   ![img](/images/iso7_crop.png)

8. ... so we can close the line and build a polygon (**the isovist!**) with it

   ```sql
       isovist_0 AS(
           SELECT
               ST_MakePolygon(ST_MakeLine(geom)) as geom
           FROM intersection_closest
       ),
   ```
   ​

9. Let's get the `polygons` that actually intersects my isovist

   ```sql
       isovist_buildings AS(
           SELECT
               -- avoid geometry collections
               ST_CollectionExtract(ST_union(b.geom),3) as geom
           FROM
               isovist_0 i,
               buildings_crop b
           WHERE ST_Intersects(b.geom,i.geom)
       )
   ```
   ​

10. Because of the `arc` resolution, we need to crop the resulting isovist with the `polygons` above to have the best level of detail. Because of [this PostGIS ticket](https://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/ticket/1078) we need to sanitize the results for the cases there's no building intersecting my isovist (all of them are further than the horizon), and it's a plain circular arc.

   ```sql
       SELECT
           coalesce(ST_Difference(i.geom, b.geom), i.geom) into geomout
       FROM
           isovist_0 i,
           isovist_buildings b;
   ```

So, finally, the full function should look like:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION ISOVIST(
    IN center geometry,
    IN polygons geometry[],
    IN radius numeric DEFAULT 150,
    IN rays integer DEFAULT 36,
    IN heading integer DEFAULT -999,
    IN fov integer DEFAULT 360
    )
RETURNS geometry  AS $$
DECLARE
    arc numeric;
    angle_0 numeric;
    geomout geometry;
BEGIN
    arc := fov::numerics / rays::numeric;
    IF fov = 360 THEN
        angle_0 := 0;
    ELSE
        angle_0 := heading - 0.5 * fov;
    END IF;

    WITH
    buildings_0 AS(
        SELECT
            t.geom
        FROM unnest(polygons) as t(geom)
    ),
   buildings_crop AS(
        SELECT
            geom
        FROM buildings_0
        WHERE ST_DWithin(center::geography, geom::geography, radius)
    ),
    buildings AS(
        SELECT geom FROM buildings_crop
        UNION ALL
        SELECT ST_buffer(center::geography, radius)::geometry as geom
    ),

                       radians(angle_0 + t.n::numeric * arc)
                    )::geometry
                ),

        LEFT JOIN
            buildings b
        ON
            ST_Intersects(b.geom,r.geom)
    ),
    intersections_distances AS(
        SELECT
            id,
            point as geom,
            row_number() over(partition by id order by center <-> point) as ranking
        FROM intersections
    ),
    intersection_closest AS(
        SELECT

            CASE WHEN fov = 360 THEN null::geometry ELSE center END as geom
        UNION ALL

            id,
            geom
        FROM intersections_distances
        WHERE ranking = 1
        ORDER BY ID)
        UNION ALL
        SELECT
            999999 as id,
            CASE WHEN fov = 360 THEN null::geometry  ELSE center END as geom
    ),
    isovist_0 AS(
        SELECT
            ST_MakePolygon(ST_MakeLine(geom)) as geom
        FROM intersection_closest
    ),
    isovist_buildings AS(
        SELECT
            ST_CollectionExtract(ST_union(b.geom),3) as geom
        FROM
            isovist_0 i,
            buildings_crop b
        WHERE ST_Intersects(b.geom,i.geom)
    )
    SELECT
        coalesce(ST_Difference(i.geom, b.geom), i.geom) into geomout
    FROM
        isovist_0 i,
        isovist_buildings b;

    RETURN geomout;
END;
$$ language plpgsql IMMUTABLE;
```



Magic!
