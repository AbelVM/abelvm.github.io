Based on the firemen stations locations extracted from [OSM](http://www.openstreetmap.com) and generating the isochrones using CARTO included analyses, this map showcase the coverage of firemen service in Madrid area. Using a water realted styling, the visual message is quite straight forward. The color scale describes the max time needed for the firemen to reach a place, and the "depth" symbolize the amount of assets that would be available at that place in that time, the deeper the better.
